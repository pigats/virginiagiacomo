  <h2>An Hawaiian dream</h2>
  <p>
    As you know we live in London, and a traditional wedding list was not practical.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we decided to ask you some help with the best holiday of our lives: the honeymoon &ndash;
    we will fly shortly after the wedding, and we will spend two weeks under the amazing sun of Hawaii.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you feel like, help us reach all of our goals: flight tickets, hotels, 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_(garland)" target="_blank" title="nā lei on wikipedia">nā lei</a>
    &hellip; 
    <br />
    We built a page for that, where you can also see how the funding goes:

    The ceremony will take place at the Church of San Ulderico in Tretto in Schio (VI).
  </p>
  <p>
    The reception will take place at the &ldquo;agriturismo Il Maggiociondolo&rdquo;, Contrà Proveste 1, S. Rocco di Tretto, Schio.
  </p>

  <p>
    The venue of the wedding is 700 meters above the sea level: although it will be the first 
    day of summer, in the evening might be a bit cold.
    <br />
    Therefore we recommend - we turn to the ladies - to bring a shawl or a shrug: it can also be useful in the church.
  </p>
  <p> 
    If you need a place to sleep, please contact us as soon as possible.
  </p>

  <h3>Directions to the Church</h3>
  <p>
    Take the highway A31 (Valdastico) and exit at Piovene Rocchette. 
    Continue for about 10 km following the signs for Schio until you reach the village of Santorso.
    Before arriving in Schio, in the locality Timonchio (at km 62 of the provincial road and at the second 
    set of traffic lights), turn right and take the provincial road SP65 and follow the tourist signs for 
    the &ldquo;località Tretto&rdquo;. Follow the provincial road SP65 for about 8 km; once we got to &ldquo;Sant'Ulderico&rdquo;, 
    you will find the church on your left, in the main square of the village.
  </p>
    <h3>Directions to &ldquo;L'agriturismo Il Maggiociondolo&rdquo;</h3>
  <p>
    After the ceremony, we will go to the agriturismo following the provincial road SP65 towards San Rocco for about 6 km.
    Once you arrive at the village of San Rocco, turn left at the church, direction "Monte Summano", 
    and continue for about 1 km until you reach Contrà Proveste.
  </p>
  <h3>For the Londoners</h3>
  <p>
    The nearest airports where you can land are: Venice, Verona and Treviso.
    <br />
    All three airports are within about a 2 hour drive from Schio.
    Ryanair lands in Treviso, Easyjet in Verona, while British Airways lands both in Venice and Verona.
    <br />
    From all three airports Schio can be reached by public transport (bus plus train).
    Using public transport is possible, but it is longer and more complicated; also once you are in Schio you will 
    be limited in going around.
    <br />
    Our advice is to hire a car directly from the airport.
    <br />
    For any further information or advice, please contact us without any hesitation.
